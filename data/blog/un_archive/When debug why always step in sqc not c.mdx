# Background

I already `db2 prep` pre-build my.sqlc to my.c, but when I debug, I always step into sqc file, not my.c file. Why?

# Trace

When you pre-build my.sqlc â†’ my.c, the compiler treats .c as the source, but the debugger may still show .sqlc due to line markers (#line directives in generated .c).

So, How DID CLion Debuger know Step in sqc? We know c debuger must cant read sqc file,
So Why it know go to the right line in sqc file?

Look my.c the result of db2 pre-build tools,We find some Strange line like this:

```c
#line 1 "my.sqc"
#line 131 "my.sqc"
      sql_setdlist[0].sqltype = 460; sql_setdlist[0].sqllen = 15;
#line 131 "my.sqc"
      sql_setdlist[0].sqldata = (void*)dbAlias;
#line 131 "my.sqc"
      sql_setdlist[0].sqlind = 0L;
```

What if we remove all these line.

```python
import sys

with open('D:/work/c/TestDB2API/my.c','r',encoding='utf-8') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

filtered_lines = [line for line in lines if not line.lstrip().startswith('#line')]

with open('my.c','w',encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.writelines(filtered_lines)
```

Resolved.
